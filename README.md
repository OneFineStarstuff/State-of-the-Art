## FAIR Software Release ✘

To make your software FAIR, it is necessary to archive it in an archival repository like Zenodo every time you make a release. When you are ready to make your next release, click the "Create release" button below to easily create a FAIR release where your metadata files are updated (including with a DOI) before creating a GitHub release and archiving it.
